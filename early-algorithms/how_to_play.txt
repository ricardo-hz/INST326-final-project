=== HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME ===

The game is your classic turn-based RPG.

1. Select up to three characters from a pool to form your party.
2. Enter combat! A turn-order shows who acts next. On your turn,
   choose abilities and targets. Enemies attack as well. The fight
   continues until one side is defeated.
3. Between combats, visit a shop to upgrade each character's weapons or armor.
4. Repeat combat and shop phases until the 6th fight â€” the boss battle.

Will humanity survive the tournament?
