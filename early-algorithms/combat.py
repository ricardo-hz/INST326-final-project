    # i think the bit is that we should have preset enemy teams, choose from a
    # list of random encounters
    # this could be a class, Team class or something. then you can input those
    # in from the gameloop.py. i dunno.
    
    # anyways intro the enemy team and then uhh combat
    
    # i cba to write this it's 2:30am
